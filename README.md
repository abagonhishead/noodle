# Noodle
Noodle is a small REST API that sends wake-on-LAN 'magic' UDP broadcast packets on a local network. It is written in ASP.NET Core, .NET 6 & .NET Standard 2.1.

## Using it
The application includes Swagger. There is only a single endpoint, and it is documented at `/swagger/index.html`.

## Building/deploying it
You should be able to build and deploy this in the normal way you build & deploy any ASP.NET Core web app. 

It will run fine on Windows & Linux -- on Linux, I recommend running it behind nginx with systemd socket activation.

It will also run fine on a Linux docker container, but it requires a fair bit of configuration to get the UDP broadcast packets onto your LAN. 

The most success I had with running this in a container was to use a macvlan interface (Linux only), which means the container appears as if it's directly connected to the local network, but this is a clunky solution -- docker still has to assign the containers their IP addresses, and also has to be informed of the physical network configuration. The macvlan interface also needs to be configured separately using `systemd-networkd` (or your equivalent network configurator) which makes deployment a bit more awkward.

If anyone finds a better way of getting UDP broadcast packets routed across from the docker virtual interface to a hardware ethernet interface then please let me know, as I'd much rather run this in a docker container than directly on my Linux box.

I haven't tested this on BSD or OS X.

## Development
It is still a work-in-progress. It needs:

- Unit tests
- A tidy up of the bootstrap class 
- Migration of the static bootstrap class to an `IStartup` implementation or something similar
- Move static helpers to instanced implementations (`InteropHelper`, `UnixHelper`) because nobody likes static helpers
- Some digging to figure out if `.ListenUnixSocket()` still has that permissions bug, as the socket permissions `Task` is an awful hacky workaround. It should also probably be updated to octal 0660 instead of 0770.

I will consider contributions but please get in touch first. Don't raise a PR out of the blue!
